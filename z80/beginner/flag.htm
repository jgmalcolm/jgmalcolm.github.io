<P>Where would we be without If/Then statements? They're
called conditions in asm. There is no If command in asm.
Don't worry though. We have what are called
'flags'. Remember when I was telling you about the
register pairs? Do you remember that <CODE>a</CODE> didn't have a
partner? It does, and it's <CODE>f</CODE>. <CODE>Af</CODE> is the
registered pair. The z80 has six flags on it total, which are
represented in the <CODE>f</CODE> register as being either set (1) or
reset (0). Remember that the <CODE>f</CODE> register contains the
flags as bits. The most commonly used flags are the 'zero
flag' and the 'carry flag', we will learn about
the others later on.

<A NAME="zero"></a><H2>Zero Flag</H2>
The zero flag is used to show us
whether the value of the indicated operation is zero: a subtraction
resulted in a zero, a decriment ended up being zero, or there was zero
difference between the two values compared.

<P>For instance, when you have <CODE>$01</CODE> stored in
<CODE>b</CODE> and perform <CODE>dec b</CODE>, the
zero flag will be set because <CODE>b</CODE> has reached zero; but if <CODE>b</CODE>
contains <CODE>$02</CODE> and you perform <CODE>dec b</CODE>, the zero flag will
be reset because it will be at <CODE>$01</CODE> still.

<P>Another example is when
you have <CODE>$09</CODE> stored in <CODE>a</CODE> and you do
a <CODE>cp $09</CODE>. The
processor will subtract <CODE>$09</CODE> from <CODE>a</CODE> and set the zero flag
because the answer is zero.

<A NAME="carry"></a><H2>Carry Flag</H2>
The carry flag tells us the resultant value was too big
to be stored in the register.

<P>When you perform a command that
results in a 9 bit answer that can not be stored in the 8 bit
register, the 9th bit is stored in the carry
flag's spot on the <CODE>f</CODE> register. The carry flag is
usually used in shift and rotate instructions which we will learn
about later.

<P>These flags are either set or reset by either a comparison or
a testing instructions. The flags will also remain set or reset
until a new comparative instruction is executed, this means that
you could have a comparative command, some code, and then the
conditional branch (jump).

<P>Here's a chart that compares the flag states to test operands
in TI-BASIC considering you used:

<PRE>	cp <I>arg1</I></PRE>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER CLASS=info>
	<TR CLASS=header> ALIGN=CENTER>

		<TD>High Level

		<TD><I>arg1</I> >= <CODE>a</CODE>

		<TD><I>arg1</I> < <CODE>a</CODE>
	<TR>	<TD>No Zero
		<TD><I>arg1</I> != <CODE>a</CODE>
</TABLE>

<P>The following chart* shows the
relationships of the flags to different operations being
performed.

<P>Note: When the carry flag is set, the zero
flag is also set.  This is not neccessarily the other way around too.

</TABLE>

<P CLASS=clsFootnote>* ZF stands for zero flag set, CF stands for carry flag set,
NZ stands for zero flag reset, and NC stands for carry flag
reset.</P>

<A NAME="cond"></a><H2>Conditions</H2>
Conditions are used in redirection commands. If the condition is true, then
the processor goes the the specified address and starts
executing code.
