Med school is all test after test after test, and so a little over a year into
it and I'm noticing some patterns.  Here are simple strategies that brought
order to chaos.  While most of this is from med-school tests, the principles
apply to nearly all multiple choice exams.

## Practice questions {#qbanks}

Only through practice on questions will you improve your technique, accuracy,
endurance, and learn what's important.  Do not passively read your review
books and notes.
[Question banks are the most effective and efficient study method][aamc].

 [aamc]: https://members.aamc.org/eweb/upload/Are%20Questions%20the%20Answer%20PPT%2011-6-12%2010PM.pdf

You should jump into doing questions [before you feel ready][retrieval].  If
you wait until you feel ready, you’re too late.  Questions sharpen contrasts,
a key part of learning to differentiate diseases and disorders.  Don’t wait
until you’ve reviewed to start questions; consider the questions and working
through the explanations as part of the learning process.  There is only one
score that matters: what you get on the exam.  Practice problem scores don't
count for anything.  In fact, you probably remember better after the small
emotional jolt of getting the answer wrong.  I find that if I guess correctly,
I'm relieved and may not pay as close attention to the explanation versus if I
had gotten the answer wrong.  If you're learning, you're headed in the right
direction.

Reviewing and accumulating all the random facts is just part of studying for
an exam; another big part is learning how to make sense of all those facts and
how they relate, an experience that you only get from working through
questions that put these random facts in context and draw contrasts.

**Read slowly.** Don't just read and nod along but parse the meaning of each
sentence.  Make sure you understand each step of the pathophysiology or
mechanism of action.  Even take the time to parse out each syllable in long
words.  In medicine and science, a lot of meaning is packed into each syllable
of words like *choledocolithiasis*.  This may all feel slow, but it's
reinforcing neural pathways and ultimately to speed up your future reading
comprehension.  Seek to understand on the first pass.  If you go fast, you'll
cheat yourself and likely end up re-reading the material anyway.  If you're
reading fast to cram more in to your study time, consider simply budgeting
more study time.  Take a shorter lunch break.  **First gain accuracy, then
gain speed.**

**Emotional reactions have a lasting effect on memory.** Wrestling with a
question and the immediate emotional and intellectual feedback of seeing the
answer helps solidify the knowledge. It's important that you commit to an
answer so you increase the emotional charge in the event you're wrong.  Giving
up and guessing is less emotional; it's better to convince yourself of one
answer, commit, and click submit. One trap I stumbled into is that even when I
got a question right but just barely, I found I got sloppy in reading through
the explanation.  In many cases it would have been better had I got the answer
wrong to grab my attention and drive me to achieve understanding.

**Commit to an answer before looking anything up.** I often find myself
wanting to look up a fact in the textbook before clicking submit, but that
lessens the emotional payoff.  It's better to think of what specific
information you want to look up and how that factors into the answer choices.
That way, when you do get to see the explanation, you really drive home the
critical details you were missing.  It's best to commit to an answer, let the
chips fall, and use that energy to understand the correct answer.  Don't worry
about getting a low score from wrong answers: *the only score that matters is
the real exam*.

There's some evidence that if you take a pretest before you've even been
exposed to material, [you'll do better][failing] when it comes to the actual
test afterward.  If your scores are not improving or you are just guessing,
you might not be ready.  Consider stepping back to review more.

**Drilling on questions also helps you understand your own psychology.**
Recognize the signs that you’re tiring or getting sloppy, and learn to
refocus.  Recognize your proclivities to jump toward certain answers and not
read the question fully.  One odd thing I noticed is that, for questions where
two answers are very close, I tended to prefer the first of the two.  Once I
recognized this tendency, I started catching myself and instead focus on those
choices without bias.  If you're consistently choosing the second best answer,
ask yourself what is it that distracted you or tipped you the wrong way?  Are
you over-thinking the question, ie. adding unnecessary "logical" steps to
justify the wrong answer?  Critically investigate what you are missing and
where you went off track.

**Doing more questions can also perpetuate bad habits.** If you stop improving
or regress in performance, it's a sign you're developing sloppy habits like
[not reading the entire question](#read) or
[not paying attention to every lab value mentioned](#abnormal-findings). Investigate
why you're choosing wrong answers to see a pattern emerges.

**Mark questions valuable to see again.** Doing an entire question bank again
from scratch is probably not the best use of your time, but some questions
teach valuable lessons and are worth returning to down the road.  Flag/mark
such questions for later studies.  But be sure to get everything you can out
of the explanation in the moment.  Don't mark a question telling yourself
you'll come back to study it later.  There never is a "later" as the pace of
life only picks up.

Practice until these techniques are second nature and you've killed bad
habits.  Techniques will only incrementally improve your performance.  There
are no true shortcuts on these exams and these techniques only work when you
already have the core knowledge.




## First sentence, last sentence

Read the first sentence and then the last sentence.  Skip everything in
between for the moment.  Skim the answer choices.  Now you've got your
context.  You know what topics are going to be relevant.  You know what type
of answer is expected.  As you go through the rest of the scenario and answer
choices, your brain is already working quietly to connect the dots.  You're
primed to pay close attention to key information as you continue reading.

At this point, you can skim the answer choices and probably immediately rule
out one or two.  In some cases, the answer is obvious (but don't jump until
you've read everything).

Now go back to read the rest of the scenario and attack the remaining answer
choices.

You’ll avoid the situation where you’re reading along thinking you know
exactly the diagnosis, only to come to the end and realize the prompt is
asking you something different like a side effect of the treatment for that
obvious disease (second-order sequence instead of first-order recall).  If you
had known the prompt, you could have been reading the scenario and already
thinking of how to make a connection to the prompt.  Wasted time and energy.

If there’s an image, look at it before reading the full question to see if you
recognize anything.  Often, after only reading the final prompt and glancing
at the answer choices, you can already rule out one or more wrong choices in
seconds.  Classic histology or gram staining is "classic" for a reason.


## Study the answer explanations

Always review explanations.  First for the correct answer, second for your
wrong answer, but also for all the other answers.  Specifically look for how
you could have ruled out each incorrect answer.  The point of the question
isn't just the information limited to the correct choice; the point of the
question is the integration and contrasts between all answer choices.

Find the topic in your notes, underline the most important physical or lab
findings, etc.  Put a small dot next to the tested fact.  Over time, the
highly tested material becomes apparent.  Not all information is weighted
equally, and you'll soon start to see which topics are most important.  Avoid
cluttering your notes and only do this for things you got wrong.  I used a
different dedicated color for each question bank.

Some topics are not that important or not substantial enough to merit their
own question, so instead they will be frequently used as distracting (wrong)
answers.  Becoming familiar with these *secondary distracting topics* is as
important as familiarity with *primary tested topics*.  Don't skimp on
studying wrong answers.

How do you know when you're read to move on to the next question?  Ask
yourself: **If I saw this again, would I be able to rule out all the wrong
answers?**



## Record learning points

Whenever you have an "Ah, ha!" moment, write it down.  Keep this very simple
and low-friction.  You don't want to complicate this because you probably
*will not* come back and review.  **Just the simple act of recording the
learning point forces you to synthesize a precise factoid suitable for
cerebral storage.** If you got a question right but just barely, consider
recording the learning point to solidify your thinking.  Just as you take
notes while you're studying lectures, treat question banks as study time and
take a few *simple* notes.  Don't waste time making these notes pretty.  Every
day you start with a new page and blank slate.

Instead of simply stating the correct answer or tested fact, put it in
contrast with the wrong answer you picked, eg. differential diagnosis.

This process will seem to slow you down, but it'll quickly pay dividends as
you speed up.  As your knowledge base grows you'll pick up speed because
you'll record fewer learning points and you'll answer questions faster.

To avoid clutter and save time, avoid writing things you already solidly know.
Instead, just let your mind stew on the concept for a moment to reinforce
those neurons before moving along.

## Review topics, not isolated details

If you get a question wrong, don't just memorize the specific fact you missed.
Go and skim over the entire disease or pathway in context.  If the answer
stems were all a cluster of related diseases, skim those and understand how to
compare and contrast.  If it was a bone tumor question and the answer was a
particular bone cancer, review the specifics of that cancer, but also do a
quick recap of the other ones.  If the answer was a particular enzyme in the
purine salvage pathway, review the entire pathway.  Take every opportunity to
learn in context.


## Attacking a question bank

Consider doing a test with all easy questions so you can start easing into
concepts and get some positive vibes going.  However, don’t be fooled into
thinking this is your actual performance until you’ve cut your teeth on some
harder questions.


## Chief complaint

The first sentence likely contains the most important clue and sets the
context.  Here are a few classic tip-offs.

* chief complaint - your diagnosis must absolutely explain this
   * whatever the patient came in complaining of is the most important thing to address
* race - anytime race is mentioned, it’s a clue
   * African-American - HTN, sickle cell, autoimmune
   * white - cystic fibrosis, membranous nephropathy
   * Greek, Italian - classic Mediterranean patients - B-thalassemia
* sex - female autoimmune
* age - diseases sometimes target a rough age range: childhood, middle age, elderly
   * 1-2 yo boy - x-linked
* obese - DM2
* occupation, home environment - environmental exposure
   * farmer, veterinarian - animal exposure, hypersensitivity to moldy hay
   * construction worker, old apartment, painter - lead poisoning
   * college student - Neisseria, mono
* exotic environment
   * an emergency department in the third world - think of old drugs not used anymore in the US
      * Chloramphenicol causing aplastic anemia (no longer used in US but might encounter in third world)
* immigrant or foreigner visiting who recently became ill
   * unvaccinated, endemic disease (late manifestations), lack of newborn screening


## Avoid outliers

When one answer is totally different than the others, it's likely a distractor.

> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of B.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of C.
> * Oxygen curve is shifted to the right because of D.
> * <strike>Oxygen curve is shifted to the left because A.</strike>

Boards questions almost always give you enough information to make a
diagnosis, and rarely is a patient without risk.  So avoid those answer
choices:

> * The patient is at risk because of X.
> * <strike>The patient has no risk because of Y.</strike>
> * <strike>Not enough information is provided to make a diagnosis.</strike>



## A single phrase can rule out an answer choice

The question prompt may mention an ancillary test that was performed whose
only purpose is to rule out one specific answer choice.

> Patient presents with X, Y, Z that appear to be some form of anemia.  In the
> course of workup, <u>direct Coombs test was negative</u>.
>
> * A
> * B
> * <strike>Autoimmune hemolysis</strike>
> * D



## Account for every abnormal finding {#abnormal-findings}

Your answer needs to explain every given lab value and physical finding.  If
there’s some seemingly completely unrelated lab value that’s wildly abnormal
and you cannot explain it with your answer, then think harder about the other
choices.  There are no wasted words in a question prompt.

**Tunnel vision.** This is especially true in disorders involving multiple
systems.  Individual answer choices may address individual system
dysfunctions, but you need to make sure that your chosen answer explains all
abnormalities.  For example, a patient presents with renal dysfunction, joint
pain, and hematologic abnormalities.  The individual answer choices might be
nephritic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and myelodysplastic syndrome.  Each
of those answer choices correspond to a chief complaint, but none answer the
whole picture.  Be careful not to jump at a single physical finding.  If
multiple systems are involved, you need to tie as many together as you can.
This patient has lupus.



## Ruling out answers          {#ruling-out}

Every answer choice was included for a reason.

Never commit to an answer without ruling out other choices.  This will make
sure you’re not just jumping for a distractor.  Once you rule out a choice,
you can completely forget about it and focus your attention on comparing the
remaining choices.

Multiple choice tests are as much about knowing the right answer as being able
to rule out all the wrong answers.  Sometimes you arrive at the right answer
only because you ruled out all the other choices.

As I got faster, I had the tendency to sometimes rule out answer choices
quickly because they seemed unrelated.  This was a bad habit because often
what seemed immediately unrelated was in fact related in an indirect way.  I
now force myself to consider what each answer choice means and why it was
included before crossing it out.

If you're unsure, skip that choice for a moment and continue evaluating the
other choices.  Sometimes the other choices will shed light on the one you
didn't immediately understand.

I often found myself picking the second best answer, and this was typically
because I was over thinking the question and second guessing the test writers.

Once you've narrowed down to two answers, ask yourself **"What is different
between these choices?"** and then look back in the scenario for specific
clues.


## Guessing intelligently {#guessing}

If you have to guess, do so intelligently:

* [Rule out](#ruling-out) as many wrong choices as possible.
* If there are multiple answers that are equivalent and one that is different,
  then it's likely the equivalent group is all wrong together.
* If two answers are the opposite of each other, then the answer is likely one
  of those.  Ignore the other choices.
* Use epidemiology to pick the most likely.  The most common disease (avoid
  [zebras]).  An adult patient with no mention of chronic or childhood issues,
  then rule out congenital diseases that would have shown up in early
  childhood (e.g. hemophilia, sickle cell).  Anything that occurs suddenly
  without any history, think acquired instead of congenital.
* Don't go for something you've never heard of until you've ruled out all
  other options.


## Classic clues

There are some triggers that should either perk your ears to a likely
diagnosis or rule out specific answer choices:

* African-American female &rarr; autoimmune
* 20-40yo female &rarr; autoimmune, multiple sclerosis
* "Patient presents to emergency room..." &rarr; unlikely a chronic issue,
  acute often means vascular
* "Complaining of progressive symptoms for several months" &rarr; tumors can
  develop over months
* Infant or first few weeks of birth &rarr; genetic
   * no family history &rarr; recessive
* female &rarr; ignore x-linked
* "multiple rounds of antibiotics" &rarr; no gut flora causing Vitamin K
  deficiency (bleeding), C diff
* medication that was recently prescribed &rarr; side effects causing chief
  complaint
* multiple sexual partners, IV drug use &rarr; consider STDs or HIV/AIDS and
  opportunistic infections
* "Family history of <symptoms/disease>" &rarr; this always factors into the
  diagnosis
* aspiring athlete &rarr; anabolic steroid use



## Question stems

Specific constructs can help clue you in.

* "What is most likely?" - forget about rare diseases, just think what is most
  prevalent.  No [zebras].  It's likely more than one answer is possible, but
  you're being tested on epidemiological prevalence to determine the most
  likely.
* "What is the next step in management?" - There might be an overall treatment
  goal, but this question is likely asking about immediate next steps.

## Answer choice tip-offs

If most of the questions (3-4) have the same base phrase but differ in the
second half, look to choose among those if you have to guess.

> Patient is having a reaction to heparin.
>
> - Discontinue heparin, do X.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Y.
> - Discontinue heparin, do Z.
> - <strike>Do something completely different.</strike>

Examine the answer choices together.  If several choices are equivalent, then
they might be ruled out together as a block.

> Question, blah, blah, blah.
>
> - <strike>Decreased pH</strike>
> - <strike>Increased hydrogen ion concentration</strike>
> - <strike>Decreased bicarbonate</strike>
> - Something else

One answer may refer to a combination of others.  Often you can ignore the
other choices not involved in that combination.  This shows up more so on
lower quality tests.

> Question, blah, blah, blah.
>
> - Dog
> - Cat
> - <strike>Tiger</strike>
> - Dog & Cat



## Three types of questions

There are three types of questions: those you know immediately, those you
don't have the knowledge to answer, and those that you'll end up pondering.
Every question is worth the same as every other question, so you can be
strategic about how you spend your time and energy.

For the easy bread-and-butter questions, answer them immediately to lock in
the majority of your points.  Mark and skip any question that requires more
than a minute of thought or where you simply don't have the requisite
knowledge.

For these marked questions, go carefully and spend the time.  These questions
will make the difference between pass and high pass.

It's a death trap to fritter away your time on questions you'll ultimately
guess on.  [Narrow it down to 2-3 choices](#ruling-out) and
[guess](#guessing).  You want to avoid the situation where you've got 10
minutes left but 20 questions, and so you make sloppy mistakes on easy ones.


## Read the entire question carefully.  {#read}

Your middle school teacher was right.  As you’ve gotten used to banging
through questions, sometimes a question will seem so easy that you jump right
to the answers looking for what you already have in mind.  Test-writers know
this too and can create a dead obvious question except for one small detail
that totally changes.  And they know exactly the trap answer to put for those
zipping through.

Make sure you've taken into consideration every single symptom and avoid the
knee jerk choice.  The first sentence here sounds like lupus, but reading the
entire question guides us to dermatomyositis.

> Patient presents with malar rash and signs of chronic inflammation and a
> positive ANA ...  Patient also complains of **proximal muscle weakness**.
> The ANA shows anti-Jo-1 antibody.
>
> * <strike>Lupus</strike>
> * **Dermatomyositis**

I can't count the number of times I've jumped to an answer after reading the
first sentence or two only to be wrong.  Unless you're clearly committed to
guessing, you better have a reason for ruling out all other answer choices
before you click submit.  Forcing yourself to address each (incorrect) answer
choice in turn will help you squeeze out these sloppy errors.
